# Guide to Running InetVis

At this time InetVis only works under 32-bit flavours of Ubuntu and requires a few older libraries to be installed for correct operation.

In order to get InetVis running in your own VM please consider the following guidelines:

1. Install your choice of 32-bit Linux in a VM (Tested with Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS 32-bit desktop edition)
  * You may choose to install the i386 architecture under your current 64-bit distrubition, however this has not been tested.
2. Be sure to update your system fully after installation
  * `sudo apt-get update` and `sudo apt-get upgrade`, finally `sudo apt-get dist-upgrade`
3.
