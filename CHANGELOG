# Changelog for Inetvis

2.1.1  RELEASE  2017/10/09
================================
General
--------

This is a minor update to the 2.1 family, it includes a few small feature additions as well 
as bug fixes to improve the macOS UX, and the relevant documentation updates.


New Features
------------

* Added support for ppm and bmp screenshots, set through the General Settings UI.
	These provide significantly improved performance at the expense of
	drive space when capturing multi frames.
* Added new keyboard shortcut, '9', to toggle the framerate on the visualisation pane.

Bug Fixes
----------
* Fixed bug where the timestamp and framerate, in the lower left and right of the visualisation pane was not displayed at all on Mac OSX Retina Displays. It now displays correctly on all displays by using the device pixel ratio to properly calculate the position to draw these HUD elements.
